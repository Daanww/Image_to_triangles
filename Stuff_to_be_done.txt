Stuff that needs to be done:
-load image specified by args, get its dimensions, put all its data in data structures
-create starting points for the triangles within the dimensions of the image
-blot the triangles to the screen
-randomly move the triangles, forming a generation of x number of children of the original
-compare triangles to reference image, the one that matches most closely is selected as next parent
-blot the triangles to the screen
-repeat randomly moving, forming generation etc.
-once difference between the triangles and reference image is sufficiently low then save the triangle image.
